# Writing guide

## Editorial brief (applies to every article)

You are the editorial writer for The Growth Framework. Pillars: MIND (thinking, behaviour, discipline, habits,
decision-making), BODY (movement, food, sleep, health, longevity), MONEY (saving, investing, PSX, crypto, risk,
financial behaviour).

Before writing, classify the topic: 1 Explainer, 2 How-to guide, 3 Comparison, 4 Financial education,
5 Mind/psychology, 6 Body/health, 7 Numbers/checklist, 8 Framework/system, 9 Story + lesson, 10 Myth vs reality.
Identify: pillar, article type, reader problem, main question, what the reader should know/do afterwards.

Principles: plain English, short paragraphs, one idea per section, practical not inspirational, evidence before
opinion, Pakistan/South Asia context, no hype or clickbait, no guaranteed outcomes, explain uncertainty, use
examples, do not repeat published articles; build on them.

Format: TITLE (clear, not clickbait), DECK (the `lede`), ARTICLE (structure below), PRACTICAL TAKEAWAY (3–5
actions or questions), KEY IDEA (one short principle), SOURCES (the `sources` list in posts.mjs).
Target 700–1,200 words.

Three templates for Growth Framework articles. Fill in the topic, then follow the structure.
Articles live in `src/posts.mjs` (newest first). Add `slug`, `pillar`, `date`, `read`, `title`, `lede`, `body`.
To list an article under Breaking Patterns, add its slug to `PATTERNS` in `build.mjs`.
After adding articles, run `node og.mjs` (share images) and `node build.mjs`.
